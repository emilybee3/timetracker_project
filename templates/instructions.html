                    <p> Activity diaries are common components of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. A crucial information gathering tool, keeping track of your
                    daily activities and moods can give you important insights into your overall wellbeing. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Getting started is super easy! Every day, you'll have the opportunity to fill out our simple activity tracker form. For each hour from 6am to 9pm you can write a simple note about what you were doing and record how you felt during that time: either red (terrible), yellow (neutral), or green (great). We take the rest from there, generating a color coded fully searchable spreadsheet representing your week!</p>

                    <p>Each day's forms are only available for that day- you can't retroactivly fill out your spreadsheet. This is for a subtle reason backed by research: the longer you wait to fill out your form, the less accurate your report of both your time spent and mood will be. </p>
